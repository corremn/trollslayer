# Troll Slayer Roguelike #
Take a psychopathic dwarf down into the depths of the ruins of a dwarf stronghold and seek a glorious death to atone for past sins. Very few dwarf Slayers fail at this. Such is their way..

## Feedback ##

Comments from the Temple of the Roguelikes [Review Commitee](http://www.roguetemple.com/7drl/2010/):

  * "Very nice interface and controls, and sports a really great dungeon generator"
  * "A quite complete and well done classic roguelike, with a good looking tileset. Play it."
  * "Pretty solid roguelike, stays close to the original formula and adds the berserking feature. Played a karateka which then became a swordsman and died on level 3. Recommendable to dungeon hackers"
